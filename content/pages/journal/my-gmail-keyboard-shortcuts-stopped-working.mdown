# My Gmail keyboard shortcuts stopped working

I've been an avid user of gmail's cool kid [keyboard shortcuts](http://r.evhead.com/hodgepodge/gmail-shortcuts.html).

A couple of days ago these mysteriously stopped working, knocking my reflexes off track.

I realized this morning that the culprit was the [Vimium](http://vimium.github.com/) plugin for Chrome, which was stealing keypresses like 'J' and 'K'. Â Vimium's settings page allows you to turn off the plugin for specific pages based on a string match (in this case "http*://mail.google.com/*").

Back to normal now!
